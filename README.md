Or clone the repository and run `./gradlew build`.
The compiled jar should be under build/libs/.

## Features
This plugin shows you the in-game days of your world every morning. You can also set a permanent display over your hotbar. In addition to this, the datapack will stop the time if nobody is online on a server to give in-game days more meaning. This plugin is perfect for hardcore challenges, lore-building, role-playing and more.

Every player can use the `/daycounter` command to customize the plugin experience for themselves:
- Change Color of Displays
- Enable/Disable Actiobar/Title/Chat Display
- Enable/Disable Bell Sound in the morning

### Do not use "/time set day/night/0...". This will reset the day count. If you want to change the time of day, use "/time add" instead.
